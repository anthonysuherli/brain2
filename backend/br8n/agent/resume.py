"""Shared resume core — resolve the tenant, get the store, select the preamble.

    resolve_tenant(create=…) ─► get_store ─► select_preamble ─► ResumeResult

Factored out of the call sites that tap a KB the same way (``interfaces/mcp/server.py::
br8n_resume``, ``api/resume.py::resume``, and the ``hooks/preamble-inject.py``
UserPromptSubmit hook) so the resolve+select trio can't drift. Returns the resolved
``ctx``/``store`` alongside the preamble so callers needing them for follow-on work
(``record_access``, snapshot counts, JSON assembly) don't re-resolve.

May raise — ``resolve_tenant(create=False)`` raises on an unknown project/kb. Callers
that must stay silent (the hook) wrap the call in try/except.
