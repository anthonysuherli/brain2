"""br8n Stop hook — session-end note writer.

    python hooks/session-note.py

Reads the hook input JSON from stdin (provided by the Claude Code harness) at the
END of a conversation, derives the repo's project/kb from cwd, and emits a
``{"decision": "block", "reason": ...}`` directive telling Claude to summarize THIS
session into a note (per the KB's note policy) and persist it via
``mcp__br8n__br8n_note``. The actual summary + tool calls are Claude's work;
this hook only emits the directive text.

Why ``decision: block`` (not ``additionalContext``)
---------------------------------------------------
Stop hooks fire *after* the response is complete, so the harness silently drops
``additionalContext`` for the ``Stop`` event — the only way to feed text back to
the model and earn one more turn is the continuation contract
``{"decision": "block", "reason": <text>}``. The model sees ``reason`` and acts on
it. To avoid an infinite loop, we **guard on ``stop_hook_active``**: the note turn
itself ends and re-fires this hook, but that second fire carries
``stop_hook_active=True`` and we exit silently, letting the session end.

Design goals
------------
* **Best-effort, one extra turn.** The directive tells Claude to skip silently if
  nothing substantive happened, so a trivial session still ends immediately.
* **Loop-safe.** ``stop_hook_active`` is honored so we block at most once.
* **Fail-safe.** Any unexpected error (malformed stdin, not a git repo, gate off)
  causes a silent exit — this hook must never crash Claude Code.
* **Importable for testing.** Logic lives in ``build_note_directive``;
  ``main()`` is thin glue. ``repo_identity``/``derive_project_kb`` are reused from
  the SessionStart hook so cwd→project/kb derivation stays identical.
